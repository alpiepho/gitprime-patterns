## GitPrime Patterns

This is a reproduction/summury of the GitPrime ["20 Patterns"](https://blog.gitprime.com/new-book-20-patterns/) book as a Progressive Web Application (PWA).

This was developed with React.js and Gatsby.  It was bootstraped from a Gatsby starter I built, and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/alpiepho/terms-pwa-starter.git.)


## Known Issues

- Subterm open/close doesn't work properly with all
- Be cautious changing data.  it is diffucult debuging GraphQL issues.


Also see [Issues](https://github.com/alpiepho/terms-pwa-starter/issues) from the Gatsby Starter project.
